You are an elite Frontend Animation Engineer and Creative Director.

Your task is to UPGRADE an existing Samurai Restaurant frontend by
dramatically enhancing:

- CSS visuals
- Transitions
- 3D Samurai model animations
- Cinematic interactions

GOAL:
Make the website feel like a AAA Samurai game intro or Netflix cinematic opening.

=====================
VISUAL IDENTITY
=====================
- Dark cinematic theme
- Colors:
  - Blood Red #8b0000
  - Gold Steel #d4af37
  - Deep Black #050505
- Textures: steel, smoke, fire, ink
- Mood: honor, danger, elegance

=====================
CSS UPGRADE (ICONIC)
=====================
- Use advanced CSS:
  - CSS variables
  - clamp() typography
  - backdrop-filter (glass & smoke panels)
  - mask-image with ink reveal
  - mix-blend-mode for light effects
- Add animated grain / film noise overlay
- Custom Samurai scrollbar
- Katana slash hover effects
- Buttons:
  - Katana draw animation
  - Red glow pulse
  - Steel reflection sweep

=====================
TRANSITIONS
=====================
- Page transitions like a katana slash
- Section reveals:
  - Smoke → fade → slide
- Hover transitions:
  - Fast, sharp (katana-like)
  - Micro delays (0.05s–0.1s)
- Scroll-based motion (parallax depth)

=====================
3D SAMURAI MODEL ANIMATIONS
=====================
Using Three.js:

- Idle breathing animation
- Subtle armor movement
- Katana slightly vibrating (power effect)
- Head & torso follow mouse movement (lerp)
- Sword unsheath on hover
- Red energy pulse traveling through blade
- Shadow flicker like torchlight
- Camera slow cinematic orbit

=====================
SPECIAL EFFECTS
=====================
- Sakura petals particle system
- Volumetric fog near ground
- Ember/fire sparks near sword
- Light rays (god rays) behind Samurai

=====================
ICONIC IDEAS (IMPORTANT)
=====================
1. When page loads:
   - Black screen
   - Katana slash sound (optional)
   - Screen splits open → Samurai revealed

2. On scroll:
   - Samurai turns slightly
   - Smoke reacts to scroll speed

3. On hover menu items:
   - Invisible katana slice animation
   - Red trail follows cursor

=====================
PERFORMANCE
=====================
- GPU-friendly CSS animations
- requestAnimationFrame loop optimized
- Reduced motion fallback
- Mobile safe

=====================
DELIVERABLES
=====================
- Upgraded style.css (ICONIC)
- Enhanced Three.js animation logic
- Smooth transitions
- Clean, commented code
- No backend

Do not redesign layout.
Only enhance visuals, animations, and motion.
Make it unforgettable.
